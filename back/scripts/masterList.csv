Cafés of the greats,"The two cafés on this corner (Café Flore and Café Deux Magots) may be pricey now, but they once were cheap and a haven for such famous thinker and writers of the café society as Hemingway, Sartre, Camus and de Beauvoir. It is still worth it to stop by for a café or a bite to eat what was experience their view. The second floor of Café Flore is supposed to be more quiet if you desire some rest from the hustle during lunch.",cafe,,,,,,"6 Place Saint-Germain des Prés, 75006 Paris",75006,,,,,

There are three great macaron places along rue Bonaparte: Ladurée (no. 21), Chocolatier Richart (no. 27), and Pierre Hermé (no. 72). Take a walk down this road towards the Saint-Sulpice church & sample some macarons from each place.

Dine and a walk along the canal,"Head from the west to north central Paris, to one of the most up-and-coming neighborhoods. The picturesque Canal Saint Martin is a popular place for locals and young people in Paris to gather. We recommend getting the crêpes at Lulu la Nantaise (67 rue de Lancry, 75010) or a fancy (but worth it) dinner at Matière A (15 Rue Marie et Louise, 75010) - reserve the latter online in advance (http://www.matiere-a.com/en/)!",explore,,,,,,,,,,,,
Start at the base of Montmartre: the Moulin Rouge and head on up!,"Take a photo of this famous home of the French Can-Can pictured in many Impressionist paintings. Shows are at night and can cost over a hundred euros for a seat (but include champagne)! Once you are done, make your way up to the top of the hill following Rue Lepic.",explore,"Montmartre has a unique feel, and one of the best ways to experience it is to go down some side roads and get lost. We strongly recommend taking a walking tour of Montmartre if you are at all curious about the history of this hill. There are also self-guided tours available online.","As you go up the hill from the Moulin Rouge, stop by the Café des Deux Moulins from the famous movie Amélie for a coffee. The bathroom has been turned into a mini-shrine to the movie! (15 Rue Lepic, 75018)
If you want to do something truly off the beaten path, go see a movie in Studio 28 (10 rue Tholozé), a movie theatre from the 1920s. If you’re not interested in any of the movies playing, still stop in and have a small drink in their (heated) winter garden.
Not afraid of the dead? Take a detour to the cemetery of Montmartre (20 Avenue Rachel, 75018). It is especially beautiful and in the fall. See if you can spot one of the famous graveyard cats or the tomb of the famous singer Dalida)

Dine in Montmarte,"There are many places to eat here. If you want a truly unique experience, head back a little bit down the hill and climb over a table (literally, it is that small) to get into your seat and enjoy the fondue (meat or cheese) at Le Refuge de Fondus (address: 17 Rue des Trois Frères, 75018). Wait til you see how they serve the wine! Get there early to ensure a seat! Already did fondue on this trip? We also suggest La Mandigotte (68 Rue Lepic, 75018 Paris, France) for quality French food and then a drink up on top floor bar of Terass” Hotel for a night cap with the view of the Eiffel Tower (12-14 Rue Joseph de Maistre, 75018)",explore,,,,,,,,,,,,
Covered Passages,"The fad for covered passages started in the 1820s, when the streets were dirty and unpaved, making even a small walk between shops an unpleasant experience. These passages were the precursor to malls: all the shops you could want in an indoor (and sometimes even heated!) area. You can book a walking tour, or see them on their own. The Guardian has a nice article (https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/mar/02/paris-hidden-passages-shopping-shops) on them, and there are maps available online.
