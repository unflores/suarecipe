Dinner overlooking the Eiffel Tower,"Trocadero square has one of the best views of the Eiffel tower (in our opinion) but with the benefit of being a little farther away from the crowds. Be sure to peruse before sitting down as not all cafés are created equal. One of our favorites is Café Malakoff (6 Place du Trocadéro et du 11 Novembre, 75116). After eating cross the street to get a snapshot overlooking the Eiffel Tower.",restaurant,,,metro trocadero,night,75016,,The Eiffel Tower sparkles for a couple minutes on the top of each hour.,,Enjoy the rest of your night!,,neighborhood,food,,16

Catacombs,"Originally, the catacombs were limestone quarries. In the late 18th century, the overcrowded cemeteries of Paris were closed, and the bones of those buried there were placed in a section of these tunnels. Today you can explore about 2 km of those tunnels, including the ossuary where 3-4 million people are resting. The history of the Catacombs and the ossuary are absolutely fascinating, and we recommend booking a guided tour. Not only will you get more information in a tour, you will also get to go to sections of the Catacombs that are not open to the general public!",museum,"Advance ticket with audioguide: 29 euros, otherwise 13 euros entry only, 17 euros total including Archeological Crypt Museum, and 5 for audioguide",,"1 Avenue du Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, 75014","morning,afternoon",75014,http://www.catacombes.paris.fr/votre-visite,"Closed on Mondays.

Cafés of the greats,"The two cafés on this corner (Café Flore and Café Deux Magots) may be pricey now, but they once were cheap and a haven for such famous thinker and writers of the café society as Hemingway, Sartre, Camus and de Beauvoir.

The bathroom has been turned into a mini-shrine to the movie! (15 Rue Lepic, 75018)
If you want to do something truly off the beaten path, go see a movie in Studio 28 (10 rue Tholozé), a movie theatre from the 1920s. If you’re not interested in any of the movies playing, still stop in and have a small drink in their (heated) winter garden.
Not afraid of the dead? Take a detour to the cemetery of Montmartre (20 Avenue Rachel, 75018). It is especially beautiful and in the fall. See if you can spot one of the famous graveyard cats or the tomb of the famous singer Dalida)

Wait til you see how they serve the wine! Get there early to ensure a seat! Already did fondue on this trip?

Covered Passages,"The fad for covered passages started in the 1820s, when the streets were dirty and unpaved, making even a small walk between shops an unpleasant experience. These passages were the precursor to malls: all the shops you could want in an indoor (and sometimes even heated!) area. You can book a walking tour, or see them on their own. The Guardian has a nice article (https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/mar/02/paris-hidden-passages-shopping-shops) on them, and there are maps available online.
